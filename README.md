UiPath RPA bot to download and scrap invoices from AFIP web portal

This is an RPA bot, made with UiPath. It takes users from an input excel file and for each user, it goes to the AFIP portal web, login,
nabigate to the invoices, download them given a range of dates, open each invoice, get the amount and notify if the user must be recategorized.
I didn't upload the config input file.
